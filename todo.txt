# Weekend Challenge: SQL TO-DO List 

## Description of What I need to build:

You are going to create a 'TO DO' application. This type of application is very common to tackle when learning a new language, which makes it extremely valuable to work through for the first time. Chances are good that at some point in your career you will tackle this again while learning another language.
