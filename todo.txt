# Weekend Challenge: SQL TO-DO List 

## Description of What I need to build:

You are going to create a 'TO DO' application. This type of application is very common to tackle when learning a new language, which makes it extremely valuable to work through for the first time. Chances are good that at some point in your career you will tackle this again while learning another language.


PHASE 1:
    Work on creating my folders and files 
        [x]Create Server folder
            [x]Create public folder
                [x] Client folder 
                    - client.js file [✅]
                [x] styles
                    - style.css file [✅]
            [x] Routes folder
                - routes.js file [✅]

    Work on installing 
        [x] JSON 
        [x] express 
        [x] body-parser
        [x] postgresql

PHASE 2:
    The html.index file need to contain the following. 
        [x] Would need h1 element.

        [x] input to add a task. 
        [x] Button to add the Task.

            [x] what the state of the task is.
            [x] should have button for complete state.
            [x] should have a button for deleting the task from the dom. 
PHASE 3:
    Work on creating my client side logic. 
    [x] Make sure the jquery library is saved in vendor folder. 
    [x] Create OnReady Function. 
    [x] Create my function to add task. 
        [x] Create ajax request to post input value to the Database/server.
        [x] create ajax request to get db results from the server.
        [x] Create a function to display results once an item/task is added. 
        [x] Create ajax request to update the status of the task.
            [x] When the complete button is clicked, the iscomplete  boolean in the db should turn from false to true.
        [x] Create a delete button
            [x] grab the id of the li being deleted.
            [x] when a the delete button is clicked, it should the li from the DOM.
            [x] Create ajax request and get the id requested to be deleted from the DOM to get also get deleted from the db.
            [] When the checked button is clicked is it should turn the database to true and on the DOM should have another class that will do come sort of text decoration
                [] the text decoration should have a line go through the text indicating the task is complete 
PHASE 4:
    Work on creating my Database -- MORE PLANNING NEEDED
        [x] Create a database table named "todo"
            [x] it should have id set to serial number assigned by the db
            [x] should have task column VARCHAR set 500
            [x]  should have is complete set to a boolean false initially
PhASE 5:
    //Require the app that I would be using in my server.js file. 
    [x]load express. 
    [x] load body-parser.
    [x] declare my port variable.
    [x]  declare routes and assign it to its right path.
